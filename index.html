                <p>Consists of business men/women who try to steal financial assets from a guard dragon.</p>
                <p>Like cops and robbers, but business men/women have to collect stock options scattered around the castle that two dragons defend.</p>
                <p>The two dragons are controlled by only one player while the other players occupy only one business men/women per player. </p>
                <p>The dragons have to stop the business men/women from collecting all stock options.</p>
                <p>As the players collect more stock options, their briefcase becomes heavier, causing the players to move slower,</p>
                <p>allowing for the dragon to catch up to them. The players can choose to drop stock options in order to move faster.</p>
                <p>The players have three lives shared among them, once they get caught, they drop all stock options, are given x amount</p>
                <p>of invincibility seconds and speed to get away from the dragon that caught them. They lose a life in the process.</p>
